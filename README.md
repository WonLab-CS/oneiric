Simulated Spatial Transcriptomic data.

## Why a package?

Simulation are an essential tool kit to benchmark computational methods. Here, we developped a simple package
that convenietly wraps the code we used to generate our simulated data. 

We hope that this approach will improve reproducibility and replicability of our results.
